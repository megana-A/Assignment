# Assessment

In  library management system, I've developed a web application using PHP and MySQL to manage books. The system allows admin to perform various tasks such as adding, updating, and deleting books. I've implemented features like user authentication, data validation, and database interaction using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system consists of multiple PHP files for different functionalities, including signup, login, book management, and database connection. Additionally, I've utilized HTML and CSS for frontend presentation, ensuring a user-friendly interface. Despite encountering some errors, I've demonstrated the ability to troubleshoot and resolve issues, ensuring the smooth operation of the library management system.
